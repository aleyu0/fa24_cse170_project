            <h1>How it works</h1>
            <p>Participating plazas offer spaces labeled as reserved. These reservation signs have digital signage that show if the license plate number in which the space is reserved for as well as the time it is reserved for.

It's a win-win: you do not have to stress about parking and the revenue collected goes to the business you are visitng.</p>
